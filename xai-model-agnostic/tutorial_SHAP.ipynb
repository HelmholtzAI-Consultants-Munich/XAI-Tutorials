    "To summarize, SHAP is a method that enables a fast computation of Shapley values and can be used to explain the prediction of an instance x by computing the contribution (Shapley value) of each feature to the prediction. We get contrastive explanations that compare the prediction with the average prediction. The fast computation makes it possible to compute the many Shapley values needed for the global model interpretations. With SHAP, global interpretations are consistent with the local explanations, since the Shapley values are the âatomic unitâ of the global interpretations. If you use LIME for local explanations and permutation feature importance for global explanations, you lack a common foundation. SHAP provides KernelSHAP, an alternative, kernel-based estimation approach for Shapley values inspired by local surrogate models, as well as TreeSHAP, an efficient estimation approach for tree-based models. \n",

Here we use KernelSHAP (*shap.KernelExplainer()*) to calculate our Shapley values. KernalSHAP is an alternative, kernel-based estimation approach for Shapley values inspired by local surrogate models. If you are calculating Shapley values for tree-based methods, you could use TreeSHAP (*shap.TreeExplainer()*) instaed, which provides a fast, model-specific alternative to KernelSHAP. As data you should use a subset of your original training data, as the Shapley value calculation takes quite some time.
