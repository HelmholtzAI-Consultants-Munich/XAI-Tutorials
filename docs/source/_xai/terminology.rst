Terminology
==============

**Explainability or Interpretability?** 
There is no a standard and generally accepted definition, and we will use the two terms interchangeably.

The Royal Society defines [1]:
- **Interpretability**: implies some sense of understanding how the technology works
- **Explainability**: implies that a wider range of users can understand why or how a conclusion was reached
