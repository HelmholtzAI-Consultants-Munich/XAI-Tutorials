# Introduction to Explainable Deep Learning on Supercomputers

Join our comprehensive course to embark on an instructive journey into the world of eXplainable AI (XAI). Throughout the course, participants will develop a solid foundational understanding of XAI, primarily emphasizing how XAI methodologies can expose latent
biases in datasets and reveal valuable insights.
The course starts with a broad overview of XAI, setting the stage for a deep dive into cutting-edge model-agnostic interpretation techniques. As the course progresses, we shift our focus to model-specific post-hoc interpretation methods. Through immersive training, participants will learn to interpret machine learning algorithms and unravel the intricacies of deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformers. They will also become skilled in applying these techniques to various data formats, encompassing tabular data, images, and 1D data.
In addition to theoretical insights, participants will engage in hands-on practical sessions to apply these techniques effectively.
Take advantage of this opportunity to enhance your expertise in XAI and acquire the skills needed to navigate the intricate landscape of AI interpretability. Enroll now and unlock the potential of XAI!

Learning outcome:

- Gain an appreciation for the significance of XAI.
- Explore the available model-agnostic and model-specific XAI methodologies.

## Requirements and Setup

This course assumes you have minimal experience running Python and Machine Learning Frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch.

It is possible to either create an environment and install all the necessary packages locally (using the requirements.txt file) or to execute the notebooks on the browser, by clicking the 'Open in Colab' button. This second option doesn't require any further installation, but the user must have access to a Google account.

If you prefer to run the notebooks on your device, create a virtual environment using the requirements.txt file:
```
conda create -n XAI-Course-2023 python=3.9
conda activate XAI-Course-2023
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once your environment is created, clone `ECCB-2024` brach branch of the repo using the following command:

```
git clone --branch Juelich-2023 https://github.com/HelmholtzAI-Consultants-Munich/XAI-Tutorials.git
```

## Code of Conduct

Participants are expected to follow our code of conduct. In order to have a nice and collaborative environment, please follow these rules:

- respect the others
- turn camera on (if possible)
- mic turned off unless you want to speak/ask questions
- raise your hand to ask question or type them in the chat.

If you have any issues that you donâ€™t want to share, send a private message to one of the mentors.
