# Zero2Hero: Introduction to Interpretable Machine Learning

This course is an introduction to eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

In this course the learner will:
* understand the importance of interpretability 
* discover the existing methods, in particular perturbation features importance, LIME, SHAP, FGC and Grad-CAM
* put your hands on three tutorials to uncover how to interpret the outputs and graphs of those methods
* learn to chose which method is suitable for your specific task
